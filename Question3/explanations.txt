1. File Creation
echo "Sample data content" > ~/sample_data.txt
-->
Creates a file named sample_data.txt in the home directory and writes sample text into it.

2. Hard Link Creation
ln ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt
-->
Creates a hard link named sample_hard.txt.
Both files point to the same inode and share the same data on disk.

3. Symbolic Link Creation
ln -s ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_soft.txt
-->
Creates a symbolic (soft) link named sample_soft.txt that stores the path to the original file.

4. Inode Verification
ls -i ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt ~/sample_soft.txt
-->
Displays inode numbers of the original file, hard link, and symbolic link.

5. Inode Analysis
ls -li ~/sample_data.txt ~/sample_hard.txt ~/sample_soft.txt
-->
Shows that sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode number,
confirming they are hard links to the same file.
The symbolic link has a different inode because it is a separate file containing a pathname.

6. File Metadata Inspection
ls -l ~/sample_data.txt
-->
Displays detailed file information including permissions, number of links,
owner, group, file size, and timestamps.

7. Disk Usage Check
du -sh ~
-->
Displays the total disk space used by the home directory in a human-readable format.

8. File Size Overview
ls -lh ~
-->
Lists all files and directories in the home directory along with their sizes
in a human-readable format.

9. Link Deletion Test
rm ~/sample_soft.txt
ls ~/sample_data.txt
-->
Deletes the symbolic link while confirming that the original file remains unaffected,
since symbolic links do not store file data.

10. Disk Utility Demonstration
du -h ~ | head
df -h
-->
du shows disk usage of files and directories within the home directory,
while df displays overall filesystem disk space usage including total, used, and available space.
